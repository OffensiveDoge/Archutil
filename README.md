# Archutil
A basic bash package installation script for Arch Linux
The light version is the original script with the in built documentation & settings removed for a smaller file size.
To Run:
In terminal: "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OffensiveDoge/Archutil/refs/heads/main/archutil.sh > archutil.sh && bash archutil.sh"
For the light version: "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OffensiveDoge/Archutil/refs/heads/main/archutil_v1.00light.sh > archutillight.sh && bash archutillight.sh"

Bugs still may exist, but all should be fine
